## Summary

This GitHub project focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of a quadruped walking robot. The project involves CAD design, kinematic analysis, and simulation of the robot's movements using Python (PyBullet), ROS, SolidWorks, MATLAB, and SIMULINK (Robotics Toolbox).

As a team lead of four students, the main objectives were:

1. Redesign the robot's legs to increase its workspace and capabilities.
2. Implement yaw, pitch, and roll motions for the quadruped robot.
3. Analyze various gaits, such as trot, canter, and pace, to assess performance and stability.
4. Conduct kinematic workspace analysis and use the kinematics equations to create simulations in PyBullet and SIMULINK.

## Introduction

The project's primary goal was to redesign the quadruped robot's legs to enhance its range of motion and increase its workspace. Quadruped robots have numerous practical applications, such as search and rescue missions, exploration in challenging terrains, inspection of industrial equipment, and agricultural tasks like herding livestock.

The motivation behind this project stems from the growing importance of legged robots in robotics research. Legged robots offer superior capabilities to navigate complex and uneven environments, making them ideal for hazardous scenarios and missions where traditional wheeled robots struggle. Moreover, legged robots show promise in reducing environmental impact, as they have lower ground pressure and consume less energy compared to wheeled vehicles.

## Mechanical Design

The new leg design enhances the robot's workspace and maintains the functionality of the previous design. This increased range of motion allows the robot to maneuver in cramped quarters and low-lying areas effectively. Additionally, the improved legs enable the robot to perform backflips, demonstrating its versatility in various scenarios.

## Kinematic Analysis

Detailed kinematic analysis and mathematical calculations behind the robot's motion can be found on our [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/Quadruped-Robot-Kinematic-Analysis-123456789).

## Results

Simulations demonstrate the robot's capabilities with the redesigned legs, showcasing its ability to maintain functionality while offering increased mobility. The robot can now lower its height significantly by moving its limbs out of the plane, making it even more adaptable to different environments.
